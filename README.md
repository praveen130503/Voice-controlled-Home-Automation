******Voice-Controlled Home Automation:**

**Introduction:**
This project demonstrates a voice-controlled home automation system, allowing users to control various home appliances using voice commands. It integrates with popular voice assistants and leverages IoT devices for seamless control and monitoring.

**Features:**
1)Voice Control: Use voice commands to control lights, fans, thermostats, and other appliances.
2)Real-time Monitoring: Monitor the status of connected devices in real time.
3)Scheduling: Schedule tasks and automate routines for convenience.
4)Remote Access: Control your home appliances from anywhere using a mobile app or web interface.
5)Integration: Compatible with popular voice assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.

Requirements:
1)Hardware:

i)Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
ii)Relay modules
iii)IoT devices (smart bulbs, smart plugs, etc.)
iv)Microphone or voice assistant device

2)Software:
